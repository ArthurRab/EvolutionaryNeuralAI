# EvolutionaryNeuralAI
A system which uses a neural network structure and evolution to teach itself how to play Snake, Pong, Etc.

This is a fun project I wanted to work on out of interest in AI and neural networks after seeing some examples of them in use online.

This system uses a feed-forward network: A neural network which feeds data in one direction, without loops or neurons connecting to themselves.
There are also no time steps invloved, the network design simply takes in values to its input neurons, and then provides it's output.
(The same network will provide the same output whenever given the same input. Identical inputs cannot provide different outputs when dealing with the same network)

I have a game of snake which is the first thing this was meant for, but I may add some other types of games to see where the algorithm works best.
